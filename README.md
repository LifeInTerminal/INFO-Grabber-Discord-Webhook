# INFO-Grabber-Discord-Webhook
Python program that grabs info of os, hardware, discord username etc. and sends it to a Discord WebHook.



Version 1.0.0:

What it does:
Program is able to grab: IP address and MAC address, Operating System name,version and hostname, CPU architecture information.
After grabbing those information it creates a file named z3k1wm6pf37wash4.txt and writes all grabbed informations into this file.
After these informations are written the program sends it on the discord server as a webhook and then deletes the file so victim won't figure out what happened.
